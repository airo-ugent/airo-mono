# Blender for Synthetic Data Generation - Tutorials
This tutorial series will teach you the main principles of synthetic data generation and introduce you to the necessary components of the Blender Python API.

> Basic familiarity with using Blender and its user-interface is helpful but not mandatory to follow this series.
> For a gentle introduction to using Blender, we recommend the [Blender Beginner Donut Tutorial :doughnut:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD).
> The total length of the playlist is a bit more than 6 hours, but you can skip parts e.g. about sculpting.

:memo: After you've completed the [installation](../..), you can start the tutorials below.
