# Changelog

All notable changes for the packages in the airo-mono repo are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project uses a [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning scheme with monthly releases, see [here](versioning.md)

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes
 - internal dependencies are now listed as regular dependencies in the `setup.py` file to overcome issues and make the installation process less complicated. This implies you need to install packages according to their dependencies and can no longer use the `external` tag as in `pip install airo-typing[external]`.
 see [issue #91](https://github.com/airo-ugent/airo-mono/issues/91) and
 [PR](https://github.com/airo-ugent/airo-mono/pull/108) for more details.
