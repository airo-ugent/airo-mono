    README: The Schunk gripper differs from the Robotiq in a couple ways.
    (1) It does not have an automatic width calibration to account for custom fingertips. A custom
    calibrate_width() routine is provided in this class, but given the Schunk's high minimum gripping force, it is
    recommended to manually set the max_stroke_setting in the constructor appropriately (refer to docstring in
    constructor for further explanation).
    (2) The connection to the Schunk gripper requires constant synchronisation, meaning that the connection is lost if
    your main code executes any other code for more than a couple seconds. For example, time.sleep() would lose the
    connection. To account for this,
    bkstools.bks_lib.bks_base provides functions such as keep_communication_alive_sleep, as a wrapper around time.sleep.
    This class handles it differently, making use of the BKSModule.MakeReady() cmd. This command will "refresh" the
    connection to the Schunk. It is hence executed before every move() command. However, it takes about 30ms to complete,
    so in addition servo() commands are provided: first call servo_start(), which will execute MakeReady(), then use
    servo() in a loop. MakeReady() doesn't have to be executed in the loop, since the movement commands themselves
    keep the communication alive.
    (3) bks_modbus OVERWRITES Python's serial.Serial.read() function which is absolutely ludicrous, a first issue that
    was discovered is that when you do serial.Serial.read(size=num_bytes), i.e. passing size as a keyword argument,
    this is not handled properly. serial.Serial.read(num_bytes), i.e. no keyword argument, works.
