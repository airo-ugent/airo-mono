# airo-dataset-tools

Package for creation and loading of datasets.
This functionality is mainly provided in the form of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) parsers.

This package is mainly used for the COCO dataset format, other formats will be added as needed.

Besides datasets, we also plan to provide parsers for other persistent data such as camera intrinsics and extrinsics.
